# End-to-End Machine Learning Project
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data collection to model deployment. It includes the following steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering data from various sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for training.
3. **Model Training**: Selecting and training a machine learning model on the prepared data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
5. **Model Deployment**: Deploying the trained model to a production environment.
6. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Continuously monitoring the model's performance and updating it as necessary.
